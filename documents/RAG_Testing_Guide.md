- **Educate** you about how text becomes tokens and costs money
- **Demonstrate** the cost impact of different RAG strategies
- **Teach** optimization techniques for real-world usage
- **Reveal** the relationship between quality and cost
- **Build** intuition about token-efficient prompting

# üèÜ **CORE EDUCATIONAL TESTS**

## üî§ **TEST SERIES 1: TOKEN EDUCATION FUNDAMENTALS**

### Test 1.1: Understanding Tokenization
**Objective:** Learn why token count ‚â† word count and how this affects costs

**Educational Goal:** Master the fundamental unit of LLM costs

**Steps:**
1. **Start with simple text:**
   - Ask: "Hello world"
   - Examine token breakdown: Should be ["Hello", " world"] = 2 tokens
   - Note cost: 2 tokens √ó $0.14/1M = $0.00000028

2. **Test complex tokenization:**
   - Ask: "What is machine learning tokenization?"
   - Count words (5) vs tokens (likely 6-7)
   - See how "tokenization" becomes ["token", "ization"]

3. **Test punctuation and special characters:**
   - Ask: "Hello! How are you? I'm fine."
   - Count each punctuation mark as separate tokens
   - Learn why careful punctuation saves money

**Expected Learning:**
- Words ‚â† Tokens (fundamental LLM concept)
- Punctuation costs extra tokens
- Complex words often split into multiple tokens
- Every token has an exact cost

---

### Test 1.2: Input vs Output Cost Analysis
**Objective:** Understand why AI responses cost more than your questions

**Educational Goal:** Master the cost structure of LLM operations

**Steps:**
1. **Ask a short question:**
   - Question: "What is AI?"
   - Note input token count and cost
   - Note output token count and cost
   - Compare: Output typically costs 2x more per token

2. **Ask the same question with different max_tokens:**
   - Set max_tokens to 100
   - Ask same question, note total cost
   - Set max_tokens to 500
   - Ask same question, compare costs

3. **Test response length control:**
   - Ask: "Briefly explain AI"
   - Then ask: "Explain AI in detail"
   - See how question phrasing affects output costs

**Expected Learning:**
- Output tokens cost $0.28 vs input tokens $0.14
- max_tokens directly controls maximum cost
- Question phrasing affects response length and cost
- Brief requests save money

## üí∞ **TEST SERIES 2: COST-AWARE RAG ANALYSIS**

### Test 2.1: Document Processing Cost Analysis
**Objective:** Understand the one-time cost of document embedding

**Educational Goal:** Learn embedding costs vs. ongoing query costs

**Steps:**
1. **Check session cost (should be $0.00):**
   - Note "Total Session Cost: $0.0000"

2. **Upload one small document:**
   - Upload `golden_gate_bridge.md`
   - Watch real-time embedding cost calculation
   - Note: "Embedding cost: $X.XX for Y tokens"

3. **Compare embedding cost to query cost:**
   - Ask: "How tall is the Golden Gate Bridge?"
   - Compare one-time embedding cost vs. per-query cost
   - Note that documents are processed once but queried many times

**Expected Learning:**
- Embedding is one-time cost per document
- Query costs repeat with each question
- Larger documents = higher embedding costs
- RAG front-loads costs for long-term savings

### Test 2.2: Query Expansion Cost-Benefit Analysis
**Objective:** Understand when query expansion improves quality vs. increases cost

**Educational Goal:** Learn to balance expansion costs with quality gains

**Steps:**
1. **Test with expansion ON:**
   - Enable query expansion in Parameters
   - Ask: "How tall is the Golden Gate Bridge?"
   - Note Section 1b: Query Expansion tokens and cost
   - Check quality of retrieved context in RAG Details

2. **Test with expansion OFF:**
   - Disable query expansion
   - Ask the same question
   - Note Section 1b: "Query expansion disabled"
   - Compare retrieval quality

3. **Test expansion with complex questions:**
   - Enable expansion
   - Ask: "What engineering challenges did they face building the Golden Gate Bridge?"
   - See how expansion helps with complex, multi-part questions

**Expected Learning:**
- Expansion adds input tokens but may improve quality
